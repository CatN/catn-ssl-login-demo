# maximum number of certificates deep to look when following a client cert to the CA root
# 
# the default depth of 1 means the client certificate can be self-signed or has to be signed by a CA 
# which is directly known to the server (i.e. the CA's certificate is under SSLCACertificatePath), etc

# +ExportCertData ...
# When this option is enabled, additional CGI/SSI environment variables are created: 
# SSL_SERVER_CERT, SSL_CLIENT_CERT and SSL_CLIENT_CERT_CHAIN_n (with n = 0,1,2,..). 
# These contain the PEM-encoded X.509 Certificates of server and client for the current 
# HTTPS connection and can be used by CGI scripts for deeper Certificate checking. 
# Additionally all other certificates of the client certificate chain are provided, too. 
# This bloats up the environment a little bit which is why you have to use this option to enable it on demand.
